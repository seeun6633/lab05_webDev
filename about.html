            <img src="image/me.png" width="400" height="500">

            <p>I am a Korean and born in Republic of Korea.
            When I was in 9th grade, I studied abroad in Canada and majored in art at Langley fine arts school. In the meantime, I came across digital design and heard that BCIT is the best in practical matters, so I entered BCIT. At first, I completed the graphic design program in BCIT, but now I am interested in Web design and entering to the Front-End Web Development program. Make Coding is still hard for me , but I'm doing it for the fun of being made.</p>
